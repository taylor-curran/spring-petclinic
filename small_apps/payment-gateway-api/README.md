# Payment Gateway API

## Artifact Design Thinking

**Platform**: Korifi  
**Complexity**: Medium

### Design Rationale
This represents a modern payment processing API typical in banking microservices. The artifacts demonstrate:

- **Korifi-style metadata** with labels and annotations for Kubernetes integration
- **Multiple buildpacks** (Java + Spring Boot) showing polyglot build requirements
- **External service dependencies** (Redis cache, payment processors)
- **Security-first configuration** with JWT tokens and API keys as secrets
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollout of payment capabilities
- **Observability stack** with tracing and metrics collection

### Key Complexity Features
- Payment processor integration (Stripe API)
- Redis caching for performance
- Rate limiting and fraud protection
- Multi-environment configuration
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Running and Testing

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Redis (for caching)
- Stripe API keys (for payment processing)

### Build and Test
```bash
# Install dependencies and compile
mvn clean compile

# Run tests
mvn test

# Build application
mvn clean package

# Run locally
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Configuration
- Set Stripe API keys in `env-vars.yml` or environment variables
- Configure Redis connection details
- Update rate limiting thresholds
- Configure monitoring endpoints and alerting

### Korifi Deployment
```bash
# Deploy using the payment-gateway-app.json configuration
kf push payment-gateway-api --config payment-gateway-app.json
```

### Test Status
‚úÖ **BUILD SUCCESS** - Application compiles and builds successfully
üìù **NO TESTS** - No test files currently present
