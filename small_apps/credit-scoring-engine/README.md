# Credit Scoring Engine

## Artifact Design Thinking

**Platform**: Traditional Cloud Foundry  
**Complexity**: High

### Design Rationale
This represents a sophisticated credit risk assessment system with regulatory compliance. The artifacts demonstrate:

- **Multi-buildpack setup** (Java + Python) for hybrid ML/enterprise architecture
- **Credit bureau integrations** with all major agencies (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)
- **Multiple scoring models** (FICO, VantageScore, proprietary ML models)
- **Regulatory compliance** (FCRA, ECOA) with adverse action notifications
- **High-memory allocation** (3GB) for complex ML model inference
- **A/B testing framework** for model performance comparison

### Key Complexity Features
- Integration with 3 major credit bureaus
- Multiple credit scoring algorithms and model versions
- Regulatory compliance automation (FCRA/ECOA)
- Machine learning model management and A/B testing
- Income verification and bank statement analysis APIs
- Complex risk threshold and decision engine logic

## Running and Testing

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Python 3.8+ (for ML components)
- Redis (for caching)
- PostgreSQL (for data storage)

### Build and Test
```bash
# Install dependencies and compile
mvn clean compile

# Run tests
mvn test

# Build application
mvn clean package

# Run locally
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Configuration
- Configure credit bureau API credentials in application.yml
- Set up database connections for PostgreSQL
- Configure Redis connection for caching
- Update ML model paths and versions

### Cloud Foundry Deployment
```bash
cf push
```

### Test Status
‚úÖ **BUILD SUCCESS** - Application compiles and builds successfully
üìù **NO TESTS** - No test files currently present
