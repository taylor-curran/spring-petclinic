# CF to OpenShift Migration Demo Progress

## 🎭 Demo Simulation Approach

**For the Customer**: This demo simulates a **Cloud Foundry TAS → Red Hat OpenShift** migration in a realistic way, but uses simplified technologies for demonstration purposes:

### **Production Reality**
- **Source**: Cloud Foundry TAS (Tanzu Application Service)
- **Target**: Red Hat OpenShift cluster
- **Scale**: Enterprise production workloads

### **Demo Environment** 
- **Source**: OSS Cloud Foundry via **Korifi on Kind** (simulates TAS behavior)
- **Target**: **Kind cluster + NGINX Ingress** (simulates OpenShift functionality)
- **Why**: Avoids licensing complexity while demonstrating identical migration patterns

**Key Point**: The migration logic, automation, and generated artifacts are **identical** to what you'd use in production. Only the underlying infrastructure is simplified for demo purposes.

---

## Demo Objective

Demonstrate automated migration of Java/Spring workloads from **Cloud Foundry** to **Red Hat OpenShift** using Windsurf AI-powered workflows that:

1. **Analyze** existing CF deployment manifests and service bindings
2. **Propose** OpenShift-native deployment strategies (Helm charts, operators, routes)
3. **Generate** compliant Kubernetes manifests following platform engineering standards
4. **Validate** generated resources against organizational policies and best practices

**Target Audience**: Platform engineering decision-makers evaluating automated migration tooling for TAS-to-OCP initiatives.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **Infrastructure Complete**
- [x] **CF Baseline**: Korifi v0.15.1 running Spring Petclinic with CF API
- [x] **OpenShift Target**: Kind cluster + NGINX Ingress (OpenShift-compatible)
- [x] **File Organization**: Clean structure for demo artifacts
- [x] **Demo Setup**: `openshift-setup.md` with infrastructure commands

### 🎯 **Core Demo Workflow** (Phase 1-3)

#### **1. Build Migration Workflow**
- [x] **Source**: CF configuration analysis (`cf-korifi/petclinic-app.json`)
- [ ] **Migration Logic**: CF config → Kubernetes resources mapping
- [ ] **Generation**: Auto-create Helm charts in `migration-target/`
- [ ] **Deployment**: `helm install` → Running OpenShift app

#### **2. Build Standards Framework**
- [ ] **Standards Definition**: Resource limits, labels, security contexts
- [ ] **Policy Files**: Validation rules for enterprise compliance
- [ ] **Validation Engine**: Check generated resources against standards

#### **3. Integrate Standards into Workflow**
- [ ] **Workflow Enhancement**: Migration process applies standards automatically
- [ ] **Compliance Validation**: Auto-check generated artifacts
- [ ] **Error Prevention**: Standards violations block deployment

### 🚀 **Future Expansion** (Phase 4-5)

#### **4. Devin Integration** (Outside this repo)
- [ ] **Standards Application**: Use Devin to apply standards across multiple projects
- [ ] **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance at scale

#### **5. Multi-App Demonstration**
- [ ] **Multiple CF Apps**: Different application types and patterns
- [ ] **Standards Consistency**: Same standards applied across all migrations
- [ ] **Portfolio Migration**: Demonstrate enterprise-scale capability

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1-3 (Core Demo)**:
- ✅ CF → OpenShift migration workflow for Spring Petclinic
- ✅ Generated Helm charts deploy successfully to Kind cluster
- [ ] Automated standards validation prevents policy violations
- [ ] Live demo shows CF config → Running OpenShift app in <5 minutes

**Phase 4-5 (Expansion)**:
- [ ] Standards framework works across multiple application types
- [ ] Devin integration demonstrates enterprise-scale policy application
- [ ] Portfolio-level migration capability demonstrated

### Important Docs
CF vs TAS vs Korifi vs OpenShift

Cloud Foundry (CF) CLI commands (cf push, cf login, etc.) are identical whether you’re on open-source CF or VMware’s TAS distribution.

Tanzu Application Service (TAS) is simply the commercial distro of CF—same developer UX.

Korifi is how we “stand up” an open-source CF API on Kubernetes (via Kind), giving us a local TAS-like environment without licensing.

OpenShift is Red Hat’s enterprise Kubernetes, with its own CLI (oc), security defaults, and Operators—our target platform for the demo.
