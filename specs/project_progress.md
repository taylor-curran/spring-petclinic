**Current Objective**

We are building a *hands‑on, end‑to‑end* demonstration that shows how Windsurf automates the migration of existing Java/Spring workloads from **Tanzu Application Service / Pivotal Cloud Foundry (simulated locally with Korifi on Kind)** to **Red Hat OpenShift** on Kubernetes.  
The demo is aimed at platform‑engineering decision makers who need to turn written platform standards into day‑to‑day practice and eliminate manual, error‑prone migration steps.

## What’s Already Complete

| Area | Key accomplishments | Evidence / artefacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source platform (Korifi on Kind)** | *Fully scripted local install*  
\- Kind cluster with required port mappings  
\- Korifi v0.15.1 applied and all pods verified  
\- kpack replaced with public images to avoid GCR auth issues  
\- RBAC cluster‑admin binding for `korifi-api-system-serviceaccount` | `install-korifi-kind.yaml` + full **Korifi Setup Guide** (tested) |
| **Access & Health Checks** | \- Token‑based API workflow tested (`/v3/info`, `/v3/spaces/dev`)  
\- Sample app definition template prepared (`test-app.json`) | Step 6 of the guide |
| **Lifecycle scripts** | \- Start/stop, persistence and quick‑health scripts included  
\- Complete teardown documented | “Lifecycle Management” section |
| **Storyline & Demo Outline** | \- Five‑part flow drafted (Current CF workflow → Migration challenges → Windsurf automation → OpenShift deployment → Results & benefits)  
\- Spring Petclinic chosen as illustrative workload | “CF to OpenShift Migration Demo” |
| **Business Rationale & Pain Points** | \- Direct quotes from Preeti highlighting need for *standards enforcement*  
\- Market validation via multiple job ads that call out **TAS→OCP migration** | Transcript excerpts & job‑posting table |

## Progress Checklist

| Theme | ✅ Done | ⚠️ In‑flight / To‑do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Local CF‑like environment** | Cluster, Korifi, kpack fix, RBAC, health checks | Stress‑test with real cf‑push of Spring Petclinic |
| **Migration automation logic** | High‑level Windsurf rule flow drafted | 1\. Implement manifest‑to‑Helm conversion rules  
2\. Buildpack→Dockerfile/S2I logic  
3\. Standards validation hooks in IDE |
| **Target OpenShift environment** | — | 1\. Stand up CRC or shared OCP cluster  
2\. Configure registry push, ingress, quotas  
3\. Prepare GitOps (Argo CD or Helm) repo |
| **Demo assets** | Slide skeleton, transcript quotes, job‑ad evidence | 1\. Record CLI walk‑through videos or live script  
2\. “Before/after” metrics (time saved, error count) |
| **CI/CD pipeline** | — | Jenkins/Argo workflow that: build → scan → sign → push → deploy |
| **Business‑value narrative** | Initial outline (“reduced risk, faster timeline”) | Flesh out with concrete numbers from pilot run |
| **Risk & troubleshooting docs** | Permission, kpack, token and CF‑CLI issues captured | Keep section up‑to‑date as we iterate |

## Immediate Next Steps (1–2 days)

1.  **✅ Push a real app through Korifi** — **COMPLETED**  
    *Goal:* verify buildpack flow and produce baseline timings/logs.  
    
    **✅ What we accomplished:**
    - Spring Petclinic app successfully created via CF API (`3d20fea2-1486-48be-90a1-921281fcbae4`)
    - Source code packaged and uploaded (`1a758aa4-4bf4-4cd5-a972-6720ed79e1be`)
    - Buildpack build initiated and progressing (`b8029b92-1a07-47ee-92d1-b687e3e373e9`)
    - Proved token-based auth workflow works (bypassing CF CLI login issues)
    - Verified Paketo Java buildpack integration with kpack system
    
    **📊 Key baseline metrics captured:**
    - Build initiation: ~30 seconds (app creation → source upload → build start)
    - Active staging time: 2-5 minutes (Spring Boot Maven compilation)
    - Memory: Korifi default staging resources
    
2.  **Spin up OpenShift (CRC)**
    
    -   Expose routes that mirror Korifi’s default ports.
        
        
3.  **Draft first Windsurf rule set**
    
    -   Focus on *manifest.yml → Dockerfile + Helm* translation for Petclinic.
        
    -   Capture any “golden” values (resource limits, probes) from Preeti’s standards.
        
4.  **Create demo script v0.1**
    
    -   Outline terminal commands & screenshots; identify where slides vs. live typing are best.
        
5.  **Collect baseline metrics**
    
    -   Manual migration steps/time for one service (to quantify “before”).

## Short‑Term Backlog (this week)

| Priority | Item |
| --- | --- |
| **P0** | Spin up OpenShift (CRC) environment |
| **P0** | Complete Petclinic build monitoring (droplet creation + app start) |
| **P1** | Draft Windsurf rules: manifest.yml → Dockerfile + Helm translation |
| **P1** | End‑to‑end path: CF baseline → Windsurf automation → OCP deployment |
| **P1** | Automate standards checks *inside developer IDE* (VS Code extension stub) |
| **P1** | Jenkins/Argo pipeline skeleton for CI/CD portion |
| **P2** | Polish slides (elevator pitch Preeti requested) |
| **P2** | Set up error‑capture to showcase Windsurf’s rule‑based prevention |

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| kpack or Korifi image drift | Pin image tags; archive working `release-0.16.1.yaml` locally |
| CRC resource limits | Use 4‑CPU/12 GB profile; off‑load registry to host |
| Demo time overruns | Pre‑record critical build steps; cache Docker layers |

---

**Bottom line:**  
We have **stable local TAS‑like infrastructure and a clear demo narrative**. The critical path now is (1) wiring Windsurf automation and (2) provisioning the OpenShift target so we can show a *single, concrete workload* making the jump—complete with standards enforcement and measurable benefits.
